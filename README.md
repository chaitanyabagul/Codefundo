natural disaster causes lose of life and property this lose can be reduced when proper safety measures and prevention would be taken place.to do all this in this project we are trying to developing a mobile app in which we make first ask the user to create their account and share their location so that we get to know their living and working areas and then we are creating group for accounts which are disaster prone areas and seperate group for normal areas.we link this app with the reports of weather climate department as well as disaster climate department so that any major news regarding disaster will immediately send to the user email so that people came to know about that news much faster.
the second thing we do is to upload some link in tht app related to the natural disaster videos from youtube in which safety measure and the precaution and prevention measure information is described so that people should prepare themselve before the disaster and this even taught people what to do during the period of natural calamitiesand how to survive in these conditions.
the third thing we perform in this app is that we uploaded all the information of the near hospitals,police station and other departments from where people get imidiate help when they contact them.
but our idea is not useful for those who do not have andriod mobile or can not access internet to overcome this we try to get information such as mobile numbers of local people which is totally remain confidential from goverment deparment so that we can send messages to those who  are not able to acess this app.
